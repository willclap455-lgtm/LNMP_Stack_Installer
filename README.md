# LNMP_Stack_Installer
This Bash Script sources the best repositories, downloads, and installs the latest software in the LNMP stack, and now also offers the newest Python 3 releases (via the Deadsnakes PPA) together with common Python tooling (including ngxtop) once the core stack setup is complete.
